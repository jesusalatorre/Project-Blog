Project Start 9/29/2016

The aim of this is to use Flask to inject some old files I have laying around with life.

This one in particular was an idea for a blog, so I'll follow through with it and finish a blogging application, using the original concept.

9/30/2016 I'm switching out the initial setup I had for one that uses Flask packages like WTForms. I got it up and running, though the login page breaks down when I try the submit button.
I added a dashboard template which I will work on once I fix everything with the login site and work out a functional entrance to the app.

Further documentation to be provided.
